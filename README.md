# Mongo db Food Standards and ratings project 
# Purpose:  This project imports JSON file data to a MongoDB. 
# The data is a portion of the U.K. Food Standards Agency data.
# The project creates a collection afresh and imports data to the 
# collection 'establishments'. We import a new restaurant entry into our 
# collection and set the field data types as needed.
# Investigation of data is then carried out through queries.
# To run the project. Make sure you have a database called 'uk_food'.
# Copy the files in the directory format they are in.
# The scripts are in the starter folder. Set your local directory to this.
# Run script NOSQL_setup_starter.ipynb. It will remove the collection needed 
# and rebuild and populate it. It will access the resources subfolder.
# Secondly, run script NOSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb.
